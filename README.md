This portfolio website covers my interests, work experience, projects, and links to connect with me. As it is a project itself, in the long term, I wish to incorporate new languages and technologies on top of the simple HTML to show my progression as a web developer.  

Few things I'm planning on adding:
1. Creating a seperate page for travel pictures. Maybe JavaScript to incorporate album effects of the images, etc.
2. A dedicated projects and skills page. Maybe a page that covers all the various technologies I have used between my computer science and statistics classes. 
3. Brainstorming other APIs to learn and add to my website!

If you have any questions/comments/concerns, please message me via email at prk8cr@virginia.edu!
