      <p>I'm a Software Engineer in the Commercial and Investment Bank (CIB) at JP Morgan Chase & Co. I received my Master of Computer Science in Computer Science at Georgia Tech and Bachelor of Science in Computer science from UVA. I'm passionate not only about software development, but also artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, and technology's implications on society.</p>

      <h2 id = "interests">Interests</h2>

        <p>I'm fascinated with almost anything that runs on 1s and 0s. Although I have applied my skills in Software Development at my internship at ST Engineering iDirect, I've explored the world outside of Git pulls, pushes, and pull requests. </p>

        <p>My second obsession is with Data Science; from how it’s collected to how it’s analyzed. I’ve taken many statistics courses to fuel my interest. I’ve used R for statistical tests and simulations, as well as to create stunning visualizations. I’ve also used SAS for Linear Regression Modeling to build interesting models.</p>

        <p>And finally, if you haven’t noticed by the image, I love traveling. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I had travelled to 38 countries. Now at the age of 23, I've been fortunate enough to travel to 45 countries.</p>

      <h2 id = "work_experience">Work Experience</h2>

        <p>At JPMorgan Chase Commercial and Investment Bank, I work in Payments Technology, engineering scalable Python-based data-lake applications and optimizing distributed systems with Java APIs. I leverage AWS services such as S3, Lambda, ECS, Step Functions, and Athena to monitor and manage software changes, while designing and implementing Continuous Delivery Mechanisms to deliver features ahead of schedule. Additionally, I develop and migrate serverless solutions from Apache Cassandra to Amazon Athena, reducing operational costs by $15,000 per month. My efforts in leading CI/CD pipeline migrations to Spinnaker and improving Jenkins efficiency have minimized build times by 30%, enhancing overall deployment performance.</p>

        <p>At CoStar Group, I contributed to the development of Homes.com by building and optimizing RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between distributed systems, reducing redundant backend tables by 15%. On the front end, I leveraged TypeScript and JavaScript to assemble user-friendly interfaces and enhance the overall user experience. On the back end, I utilized the .NET Framework, C#, and SQL to configure features and resolve bugs, supported by tools like Swagger, Postman, and Elasticsearch. Additionally, I collaborated closely with product management to gather requirements, align development with business goals, and ensure new features met specifications, ultimately improving product quality and stakeholder satisfaction.</p>

        <p>During my internship with JPMorgan Private Bank, I developed and deployed a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of distinguishing between real and forged signatures. The model achieved an impressive 94.7% accuracy and 93.3% recall on both public and private datasets. This work demonstrates my expertise in deep learning, model training, and deployment for practical applications.</p>
      
      <h2 id = "projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>My favorite project has been <a href="https://github.com/prithvikin/video-games-with-R" target="_blank">Video Games with R</a>. It’s a report-style project where I harnessed R to create powerful data visualizations and statistical tests on a data set of video games from 1980 to 2016. I’ve been a gamer my whole life, but this project gave me an appreciation of not just the games I played, but also the industry as a whole.</p>
