      <p>I'm Prithvi Kinariwala, a Second Year studying Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I'm passionate not only about software development, but also cybersecurity, data science, deep learning, and technology's implications on society.</p>

      <h2 id = "interests">Interests</h2>

        <p>I'm fascinated with almost anything that runs on 1s and 0s. Although I have applied my skills in Software Development at my internship at ST Engineering iDirect, I've explored the world outside of Git pulls, pushes, and pull requests. </p>

        <p>My second obsession is with Data Science; from how it’s collected to how it’s analyzed. I’ve taken many statistics courses to fuel my interest. I’ve used R for statistical tests and simulations, as well as to create stunning visualizations. I’ve also used SAS for Linear Regression Modeling to build interesting models.</p>

        <p>Apart from technical work, I am a part of the UVA International Relations Organization. I am part of the leadership that plans UVA’s high school Model United Nations conference, VAMUN, for students across the eastern seaboard. On top, I’m on the editorial board for The Spectra: The Virginia Engineering and Science Research Journal. Although computer nerds aren’t always seen to give public speeches or join editorial boards, I find these skills important for anyone.</p> 

        <p>And finally, if you haven’t noticed by the image, I love travelling. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I had travelled to 38 countries. If none of my technical qualifications are interesting, please consider reaching out just to talk about travel. </p>

      <h2 id = "work_experience">Work Experience</h2>
        <p>This is a website, not a resume. My work experience is as unique as I am. </p>

        <p>For two summers in high school, I interned alongside Transmission and Distribution Planning Engineers at Potomac Power Electric Company (Pepco). Although a far cry from Software Development, the experience fueled my interest in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>

        <p>Now in College, I work with Software Development teams at ST Engineering iDirect in the satellite communications industry. I like to think that I have learned more on the job than a few of my classes in college :/</p>

        <p>For those more interested, specifics of my work can be found on my linked resume. </p>
      
      <h2 id = "projects">Projects</h2>
        <p>My favorite project has been Video Games with R. It’s a report-style project where I harnessed R to create powerful data visualizations and statistical tests on a data set of video games from 1980 to 2016. I’ve been a gamer my whole life, but this project gave me an appreciation of not just the games I played, but also the industry as a whole.</p>
